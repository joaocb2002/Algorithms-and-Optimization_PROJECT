# How to run the Script

Running the script in Matlab will execute all the tasks in their corresponding sequence. All the plots from tasks 1 to 16 will be displayed and saved with the name "Taskn.png" where n corresponds to the number os the task.

At task 9 the user will be presented with a blank graph for entering trajectories. Using the left mouse button, the reference points for the trajectory can be selected. Once all the points have been entered, click on the space button to finish.

Tasks 10,11 and 12 will iterate over various values of mu and may take a while. Check the terminal to view the status of the iteration.

Task 13: Same as task 9 but with a maximum of 2 points.

Results of tasks 14,15 and 16 will be saved or/and displayed on the console.
